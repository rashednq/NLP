    "\n",
    "1. **Acquire and extract text data** from external sources (Kaggle datasets)\n",
    "2. **Apply Arabic-specific preprocessing techniques** including:\n",
    "   - Text cleaning (removing URLs, handles, hashtags)\n",
    "   - Normalization (removing Arabic elongations and diacritics)\n",
    "   - Tokenization (breaking text into tokens)\n",
    "   - Stemming (reducing words to root forms)\n",
    "   - Stop word removal\n",
    "3. **Understand the importance of preprocessing order** and why it matters\n",
    "4. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on text data to understand:\n",
    "   - Class distribution\n",
    "   - Text length distributions\n",
    "   - Language detection\n",
    "   - Vocabulary analysis\n",
    "   - Word frequency patterns by class\n",
    "5. **Recognize preprocessing trade-offs** (speed vs. accuracy, information loss vs. efficiency)\n",
    "6. **Use appropriate tools** for Arabic NLP (PyArabic, NLTK, Qalsadi, CAMeL Tools)\n",
    "\n",
    "An **NLP pipeline** (as introduced in Module 1) is a systematic sequence of steps that transforms raw text into a format suitable for machine learning models.\n",

    "## Glossary of Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Corpus** (plural: corpora): A collection of text documents used for linguistic analysis or training NLP models. In this lab, our corpus is the Arabic reviews dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokenization**: The process of breaking text into smaller units called tokens (words, subwords, or characters). As you learned in Module 1, tokenization is a fundamental step in the NLP pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stemming**: A rule-based technique that reduces words to their root or stem form by removing prefixes and suffixes. For example, \"running\", \"runs\", \"ran\" → \"run\". Faster but less accurate than lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemmatization**: A dictionary-based technique that converts words to their base form (lemma) using linguistic knowledge. More accurate than stemming but slower. For example, \"better\" → \"good\" (stemming might not catch this).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stop Words**: Common words that appear frequently but carry little semantic meaning (e.g., \"the\", \"is\", \"at\" in English; \"في\", \"من\", \"إلى\" in Arabic). Removing them can reduce vocabulary size and computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalization**: The process of converting text to a standard form. This includes case folding (lowercase), removing diacritics (in Arabic), and handling elongations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vocabulary**: The set of unique tokens (words) in a corpus. Building a vocabulary is essential for converting text to numerical representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Leakage**: When information from the test set inadvertently influences the training process. We prevent this by splitting data before preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. In NLP, this includes examining class distributions, text lengths, and word frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing Pipeline**: A sequence of preprocessing steps applied in a specific order. The order matters because later steps depend on earlier ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Data acquisition** from external sources (like Kaggle) requires proper authentication and data extraction techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is essential before preprocessing to understand:\n",
    "  - Class distribution (balanced vs. imbalanced datasets)\n",
    "  - Text length distributions (identifying outliers)\n",
    "  - Language detection (ensuring expected language)\n",
    "  - Vocabulary characteristics (size, frequency patterns)\n",
    "  - Class-specific word patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data splitting** must occur before preprocessing to prevent data leakage from test set to training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocessing order matters critically**:\n",
    "  1. Extract structured information (URLs, handles, hashtags)\n",
    "  2. Normalize text (remove elongations, diacritics)\n",
    "  3. Tokenize\n",
    "  4. Stem/Lemmatize\n",
    "  5. Remove stop words last\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Preprocessing trade-offs** exist between:\n",
    "  - Speed vs. accuracy (stemming vs. lemmatization)\n",
    "  - Simple models needs simple features and vice-versa (stop words removal)\n",
    "  - Vocabulary size vs. computational cost\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding your data through EDA guides preprocessing decisions and helps build effective NLP pipelines for Arabic text classification."
